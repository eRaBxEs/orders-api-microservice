1. Add a GoDotEnv file to automatically load configuration from a .env file
2. Move the repo handler and model packages into a single order package, we have an order package already defined, group them by the domain
3. Replace the references to the repo handler with a Repo interface which will allow one to swap these out to another data store in the future
4. Swapping to another data store in the future. create a new repository for postgres and storing the new order there.
5. Add automated end to end testing to this which will be very challenging but it will help you with the developer experience.
